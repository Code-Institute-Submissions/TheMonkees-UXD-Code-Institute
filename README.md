## Testing

Below is testing conducted on the website.

- Testing the Booking form
    1. Click on 'Booking' in the navigation bar.
    2. First I clicked the 'Send Request' button - As expected, no request was sent as no information was filled in.
    3. After filling in the form I clicked the 'Send Request' button again, this time the submission was successful. This is noted by the information appearing in the URL. 
    4. As a further measure I filled out the form but then removed the @ symbol from the e-mail address. As expected the form failed to sumbit due to incorrect formatting of the e-mail address.

- Testing links betweens pages  
    For this section I tested all of the links between the pages, navigation bar and and links built into the page. Testing all of the links resulted in everything linking to another page in the website working as intended by staying within the tab. 

    All links to which the user is directed to another site opened in a seperate browser tab. These links include social site and the third-party ticket purhcasing site. 


- Issues discovered while testing and how they were rectified.

    1. Issues number one was that on Microsft Edge jQuery script wasn't being pulled through due to the link not using a secure https connection from the jQuery CDN. Since jQuery was loading in, in a mobile view the button to use toggle the navigation wasn't working. The issue was rectified by using Googles jQuery API.
    
    2. Issue number two was on Microsoft Edge and Github Pages for other users the font Caevet wasn't loading in. After checking the main.css file I found that the `@font-face` source was looking at a different folder so therefore wasn't loading in and given a 404 error in the console. This was rectified by inputting the correct file path `../assets/Fonts/Caveat-Regular.ttf`

For testing the responsive aspect of the website I used a Google Chrome Extension called [Window Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en) to resize the  Google Chrome Window to various device sizes.

This website is currently viewable with no deployment issues in:

- Google Chrome
- Edge/IE

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was the editor that I used in the coding of the website. While using Visual Studio Code I used an extension pack called LiveServer to run the website on my local machine for testing.
